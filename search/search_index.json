This benchmark evaluates the motion of various road users, including vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and motorbikes, captured from a forward-facing camera. It challenges models to perform reliably under diverse traffic conditions, such as high congestion levels, unpredictable pedestrian movements, and frequent lane changes.</p> <p>The dataset encompasses 8,806 unique tracking IDs, featuring:</p> <p>8,076 vehicles 568 pedestrians 158 motorbikes 14 cyclists With an average tracking duration of 6.5 seconds, this benchmark sets a rigorous standard for evaluating tracking algorithms in real-world traffic scenarios.  | |------------------------|-------------------| | Video              | Description   | |------------------------|-------------------| | Video              | Description   |</p>"},{"location":"road_uae_dataset/","title":"ROAD-UAE Dataset","text":""},{"location":"road_uae_dataset/#coming-soon","title":"Coming soon ...","text":""}]}
